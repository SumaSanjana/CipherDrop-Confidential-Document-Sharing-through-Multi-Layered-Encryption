# CipherDrop-Confidential-Document-Sharing-through-Multi-Layered-Encryption

## üìÑ Abstract

In today‚Äôs era of rampant data exchange, safeguarding sensitive file transfers is essential. CipherDrop is a web-based file-sharing platform built with **Flask**, designed to securely transfer documents such as PDFs and images between authenticated users. It employs **multi-layered symmetric encryption (Fernet, AES, Triple DES)** and ensures decryption keys are shared separately via email. This **dual-channel security model** significantly strengthens confidentiality and privacy for academic, professional, and enterprise communications.

## üîê Key Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Encryption:** Choose from Fernet, AES, or Triple DES for securing files.
- **Dual-Channel Delivery:** Files stored on the server; decryption keys sent via email.
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration, login, and session management.
- **File Upload & Decryption:** Upload encrypted files and decrypt them via the interface.
- **Email-Based Key Dispatch:** Keys are transmitted using secure SMTP with TLS.
- **Max File Size Supported:** 10MB
